Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git is incredibly useful for collaborative projects as it
facilitates code management. Being able to track changes in code allows
for easy reversions in the event something bad occurs with the current
version. In terms of development, Git's branching and merging
capabilities enable isolated development and smooth integration of new
features into the master branch. Overall, Git is a useful tool that facilitates
collaboration.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it 
might help

Answer: Data Science can be applied to finances, especially with 
trading. Stockbrokers and data scientist can look at historical market 
data, transactions, and current news (that may impact value) to build 
models that predict market trends and optimal times to trade. This can 
help with investment strategies, manage risk better, and ultimately 
result in better financial decisions to increase profit.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging preserves the history of all branches, enabling a person 
to see the full history of changes made throughout a project. On the 
other hand rebasing takes the commits of a branch and places it on the 
tip of the main branch, which essentially rewrites the projects history 
with brand new commits for each commit in the original. Merging shows 
the various branching and merges (which can become messy to look at at),
while rebasing results in a linear history.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to learn more about the basics of machine learning so I 
can build and evaluate models that will be valuable for making 
data-driven predictions and decisions. Furthermore, I wish to improve my 
proficiency with Python and the various libraries and frameworks like 
Pandas and Matplotlib so I can apply this to machine learning.
